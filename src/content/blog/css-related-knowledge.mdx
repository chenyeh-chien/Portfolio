**box-sizing:**  
1. By default `box-sizing: content-box`, paddings and borders are not part of the width and height of an element.
2. `box-sizing: border-box`: The width and height will include the content, padding and border (but not the margin).

**Border and Margin Behavior:**  
1. **Borders do not collapse** or overlap with those of adjacent elements. Each element’s border is rendered individually.
2. **Margins can collapse**, but only vertically and only between block-level elements. Horizontal margins do not collapse. This means that if one block element has a bottom margin and the next has a top margin, only the larger of the two will be used. This behavior is independent of box-sizing and is the default in CSS.

**display:**
- Margins and paddings: 
1. `inline`: Only horizontal sides respected. Vertical sides, if specified, do not affect layout. Vertical space it takes up depends on line-height, even though the border and padding appear visually around the content.

**position:**  
1. `absolute`: The element is removed from the flow of the page and positioned at a specified position relative to its closest positioned ancestor if any, or otherwise relative to the initial containing block. Absolutely-positioned boxes can have margins, and they do not collapse with any other margins. These elements do not affect the position of other elements.


**Questions:**
