****

**box-sizing:**  
1. By default `box-sizing: content-box`, paddings and borders are not part of the width and height of an element.
2. `box-sizing: border-box`: The width and height will include the content, padding and border (but not the margin).

****

**Border and Margin Behavior:**  
1. **Borders do not collapse** or overlap with those of adjacent elements. Each element’s border is rendered individually.
2. **Margins can collapse**, but only vertically and only between block-level elements. Horizontal margins do not collapse. This means that if one block element has a bottom margin and the next has a top margin, only the larger of the two will be used. This behavior is independent of box-sizing and is the default in CSS.

****

**display:**
- Margins and paddings: 
1. `inline`: Only horizontal sides respected. Vertical sides, if specified, do not affect layout. Vertical space it takes up depends on line-height, even though the border and padding appear visually around the content.

****

**position:**  
1. `absolute`: The element is removed from the flow of the page and positioned at a specified position relative to its closest positioned ancestor if any, or otherwise relative to the initial containing block. Absolutely-positioned boxes can have margins, and they do not collapse with any other margins. These elements do not affect the position of other elements.

****
**strict equality operator:**  
1. As a general rule of thumb, never use the == operator, except for convenience when comparing against null or undefined, where a == null will return true if a is null or undefined.
2. Object.is() vs ===: The only difference between Object.is() and === is how they treat of `signed zeros` and `NaN` values. The === operator (and the == operator) treats the number values -0 and +0 as equal, but treats NaN as not equal to each other.

****

**events:**  
1. event delegation: Not all events can be delegated because they are not bubbled. Non-bubbling events include: `focus`, `blur`, `scroll`, `mouseenter`, `mouseleave`, `resize`, etc.
2. addEventListener(a, b, option): set option to true for event capturing; set option to false for event bubbling; default is false.

`<script>`:  

|  Feature   | `<script>`  | `<script async>` | `<script defer>` |
|  ----  | ----  | ----  | ----  |
| Parsing behavior | Blocks HTML parsing | Runs parallel to parsing | Runs parallel to parsing |
| Execution order | In order of appearance | Not guaranteed | In order of appearance |
| DOM dependency | No | No | Yes (waits for DOM) |

`<script defer>`:  
1. Similar to `<script async>`, `<script defer>` also downloads the script in parallel to HTML parsing but the script is only executed when the document has been fully parsed and before firing DOMContentLoaded.

****

**arrow function:**  
1. Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors and will throw an error when used with the new keyword.
```javascript
const Foo = () => {};
const foo = new Foo(); // TypeError: Foo is not a constructor
```
