> Start by understanding the Requirements, defining the high level Architecture and the Data Model. Then define the Interfaces between the components in the product and talk about any Optimizations or dive deep into specific areas which require special attention.

- Requirements exploration:
**Functional requirements**: Basic requirements of the product such that the product cannot function without them. This is usually whether a user can complete the core flows correctly.
**Non-functional requirements**: Requirements that are viewed as improvements to the product, but not strictly required for the product to be usable, i.e. the product can still be used without these. These include performance (how fast the page loads, how fast the interaction takes), scalability (how many items can be present on the page), good user experience, etc.
