****

> The best practice for RESTful API design is that path parameters are used to identify a specific resource or resources, while query parameters are used to sort/filter those resources.

#### Path Parameters
```txt
GET /cars
GET /cars/:id
POST /cars
PUT /cars/:id
DELETE /cars/:id
```

#### Query Parameters
```txt
GET /cars?color=blue
GET /cars?color=blue&brand=ferrari
```
