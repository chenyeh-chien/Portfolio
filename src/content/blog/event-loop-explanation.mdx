### Call stack:  
Call stack keeps track of the functions being executed in a program. When a function is called, it is added to the top of the call stack. When the function completes, it is removed from the call stack. This allows the program to keep track of where it is in the execution of a function and return to the correct location when the function completes. As the name suggests it is a Stack data structure which follows last-in-first-out.

### Web APIs/Node.js APIs:  
Asynchronous operations like setTimeout(), HTTP requests, file I/O, etc., are handled by Web APIs (in the browser) or C++ APIs (in Node.js). These APIs are not part of the JavaScript engine and run on separate threads, allowing them to execute concurrently without blocking the call stack.

### Task queue / Macrotask queue / Callback queue:  
The task queue, also known as the macrotask queue / callback queue / event queue, is a queue that holds tasks that need to be executed. These tasks are typically asynchronous operations, such as callbacks passed to web APIs (setTimeout(), setInterval(), HTTP requests, etc.), and user interface event handlers like clicks, scrolls, etc.

### Microtasks queue:  
Microtasks are tasks that have a higher priority than macrotasks and are executed immediately after the currently executing script is completed and before the next macrotask is executed. Microtasks are usually used for more immediate, lightweight operations that should be executed as soon as possible after the current operation completes. There is a dedicated microtask queue for microtasks. Microtasks include promises callbacks (then(), catch(), and finally()), await statements, queueMicrotask(), and MutationObserver callbacks.
