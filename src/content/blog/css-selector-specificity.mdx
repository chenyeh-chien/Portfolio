The specificity algorithm is basically a three-column value of three categories or weights - ID, CLASS, and TYPE - corresponding to the three types of selectors. The value represents the count of selector components in each weight category and is written as `ID - CLASS - TYPE`. 

1. **ID**: This is the count of ID selectors (e.g., `#example`).
2. **CLASS**: This is the count of class selectors (e.g., `.my-class`), attribute selectors (e.g., `[type="radio"]`), and pseudo-classes (e.g., `:hover`).
3. **TYPE**: This is the count of type selectors (element names, e.g., `h1`, `div`) and pseudo-elements (e.g., `::before`).

It's a better practice to write CSS rules with low specificity so that they can be easily overridden if necessary.
